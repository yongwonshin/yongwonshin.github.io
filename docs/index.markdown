I'm graduate student in Graduate School of Artificial Intelligence at POSTECH. I'm interested in developing a compiler and runtime for modern heterogeneous systems.

Our lab is in [Advance Computing Systems Group](http://syslab.postech.ac.kr/). Lab homepage is at [CODE Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/code-postech/).
